# Penguin Prizes Giveaways
PPG is a distributed, permissionless, and trustless Dapp for running giveaways. The PPG protocol allows users to create giveaways where all parties can programmatically verify the validity of all giveaways and their winners. The core logic of PPG lives in a smart contract.

## What Prizes Can be Given Away?
The initial goal of PPG is to allow users to give away NFTs and tokens to participants.

## How Does the Protocol Work?
- Users create a giveaway by submitting the prize they wish to giveaway, the giveaway name, start date, duration, and in the case of tokens, how many winners the giveaway can have, all through a transaction.
- Once the giveaway has been successfully submitted and the start date has commenced, participants can join the giveaway.
- Participants can also invite others to the giveaway, which results in both parties receiving points.
- When the giveaway ends, participants are chosen randomly based on a weighted random function that accounts for their points.
- The giveaway winner receives the prize in the account they used to sign up for the giveaway with.
